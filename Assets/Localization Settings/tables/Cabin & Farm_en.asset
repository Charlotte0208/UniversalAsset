    m_Localized: '1901, the cottage. The owners of the house, John and Mary, are
      preparing for the cold winter before their eldest son, Robert, is born.

      As
      a family that has run the farm for centuries, the Millers have always been
      self-sufficient in their daily necessities, from dried wood to delicious apple
      pie.'

    m_Localized: Not only food, but also making furniture and building houses by
      themselves is common for people on the farm. Since John and Mary got married
      five years ago, they have been adding bricks and tiles to the wooden house
      little by little, turning it into a small home with a warm atmosphere.

    m_Localized: In addition to crops, the hardworking young couple also find other
      ways to increase their family's income. John is good at gathering and hunting,
      and in addition to meat, warm fur is also very popular in the neighborhood.
      As for the sweet and sour fruits, they were carefully baked into various kinds
      of bread and snacks by Mary's skillful hands. So over the years, the Millers
      have amassed a small fortune.

    m_Localized: While the two are happy with their current life, they also know
      that farming from generation to generation is not a long-term solution. They
      love to read books and newspapers, learn about the history of their own country,
      and hear about the rapid development of cities far away from them. Sometimes,
      they also secretly hope that their children can stand on the tide of the development
      of The Times.

    m_Localized: These are the weapons John uses for hunting, two of which were given
      to him by his father. He made rugs and bedding from the fur he hunted, and
      by doing so he lasted through the most difficult winters.

    m_Localized: Although the Millers have installed electric lights as a family
      with better conditions in the surrounding area, candles are still a necessity
      for this rural family because the power system near the farm is unstable and
      often affected by heavy snow, wind and rain. The warm candlelight is not only
      the childhood of the stove, but also an inch of hope when the thick snow blocks
      the door and the dry firewood is used up.

    m_Localized: In 1930, John and Mary are both missing. Mary died of tuberculosis
      several years ago, and John, whose body was no longer strong due to long-term
      labor, fell ill after the Great Depression of 1929, which dealt a devastating
      blow to the farm's income. Now their eldest son Robert has established a business
      in the city, and the only remaining laborers on the farm are the second son
      William and the youngest daughter Helen. Helen is only 14 years old this year.

    m_Localized: The family bought this in the 1920s before Mary died. It was 80%
      new, dark red to match the farm decoration, and the body was modified by John
      and William to make it more convenient for transporting grain. Sometimes, if
      the four of them want to go to the market together, the loving couple would
      sit on the seat, and young William would always sing to his babbling sister
      in the morning breeze and sunset.

    m_Localized: Even after decades, Mary's favorite thing to do in her spare time
      is still to sew sweaters while basking in the sun in a rocking chair. However,
      after giving birth to three children, she no longer bothers to study the popular
      patterns, but tries to use the warmest wool to knit the thickest and most airtight
      scarves and hats. She keeps some at home, and the warmest one is always carefully
      packed in a paper bag, along with thick envelopes and cookies baked by her
      children, and sent to Robert in the east.
