    m_Localized: Helen left home with William. Although the siblings no longer lived
      in the cabin, they had always kept in touch with each other. Before leaving,
      one said goodbye to his wife and children, and the other packed all her luggage.
      Before leaving for the conscription point, they checked the last baggage taken
      from home for the other. Is the rope tied tightly? It is. If the rope between
      us breaks, I will bless you silently with all my sincerity.

    m_Localized: When he left home, he took the gun on the wall with him. Thanks
      to the careful maintenance of three generations, the barrel was covered with
      dust but not rusted, and the wooden grip had faint traces of calluses on the
      palms of his father and grandfather. Now it has fired its last bullet and lies
      on the soil full of shells. William looks at it and thought, I may not be able
      to take you home any more.

    m_Localized: Before William lost his last bit of mobility, he dragged his teammates
      who were injured but still alive to the trench. This place is far away from
      the front line, leeward, and there is an abandoned medical tent that could
      shield him from shrapnel and heavy rain. He started a fire, tried to keep his
      comrades warm, and fired the only remaining flare into the air.

    m_Localized: In the winter of 1941, 32-year-old William arrives at the battlefield
      of World War II. Both he and his sister gave up their farm and came to the
      front. However, unlike his sister who has not yet started a family, William
      already has a wife and a pair of children. The siblings are Susan and Richard,
      and they are both studying in the city. Before leaving, their last memory of
      each other is a deep hug.
