    m_Localized: Items that are always available in a field hospital. The toolbox
      contains some weapons for self-defense, and ropes are indispensable no matter
      where you are. In this chaotic period when the supply of materials from the
      outside world is extremely unstable, the nurses led by Helen cannot use the
      items in the box at will unless it is absolutely necessary, nor can they disclose
      the contents to every injured person without restraint.

    m_Localized: After parting with William, Helen came to the field hospital closest
      to the front line. She has nothing to lose, so she has nothing to retreat from.
      Therefore, when she learned that typhus was spreading in the crowded hospital,
      although worried about the health of the soldiers, she was not afraid of contracting
      the fatal disease herself. However, when she grasped the first words of the
      newly rescued soldier after waking up one day, "Save William Miller", she finally
      faced the reality that she could never go back to the time when she was a child
      and ride in a truck filled with the aroma of wheat with her brother any longer.

    m_Localized: Before used to hold medical drugs, it was a suitcase brought by
      Helen. But now that she has arrived, the suitcase with her luggage has lost
      its original job. Different doctors, nurses, and injured people have taken
      the medicine in it or held its handle tightly in the days passed.

  - m_Id: 419066404864
    m_Localized: Storing a lot of medicines, gauze, needles and scalpels. Only a
      small part was prepared at the beginning of the war, and the rest came from
      material supplies and people's help.

    m_Localized: She is about the same age as Helen and was a primary school teacher
      before coming here. But unlike Helen, she got married in her hometown and has
      two daughters.

    m_Localized: The bed sheets from the hospital are made into simple curtains with
      holes punched in them. On the one hand, it is to block the enemy's sight, and
      on the other hand, it can allow doctors and nurses to focus more on treating
      the wounded.
