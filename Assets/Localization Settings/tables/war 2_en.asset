    m_Localized: "1962, Vietnam.\r\nDavid Miller is participating in the first and
      last war in his life and came to this alien country. He thinks of his uncle
      David who died in the battlefield of World War II. What was his mood for participating
      in the war?\r\nHe also thinks of his father Robert who made his fortune in
      the automobile industry and his brother Michael who inherited his father's
      business. On the other side of the ocean, they know that he is here and that
      he might never return home, so how long will their memories for him last?\r\nHe
      fires a gun and is hit by a bullet.\r"

    m_Localized: Civilians who originally lived in the war district have moved into
      the safe zone in advance. It is human instinct to seek benefits and avoid harm,
      no matter how many precious personal belongings and memories they have in the
      house.

    m_Localized: "William's daughter Susan later became an elementary school teacher.
      One day, she had a dream.\r\nIn the dream, the sky was an endless white ocean,
      the sun was warm, and she, still young and naive, was running on the lawn with
      her childhood playmates.\r\nBut in the blink of an eye, the white sky turned
      black, a black curtain fell from the sky, and she heard the sound of bullets.
      War, misfortune, and the torrent of the times engulfed every member of her
      family, including herself.\r"

      humans air superiority, and a powerful war tool.

      People are fighting
      to the death to develop technology and military, but in the end, the guns are

    m_Localized: When the roof of the house next to him collapsed, David was almost
      crushed. He thought ironically to himself that maybe his uncle William was
      lucky, at least he had enough time to reminisce before the end of his life,
      but now, fighting in the daytime when he is almost completely visible to the
      enemy, any accident may easily take his life.
